## Part 1: Filter the list of movies by rating (15 points)

_Suggestion: Read this whole page before starting to code!  There's
hints and an overview of the big picture here!_

Enhance RottenPotatoes as follows. At the top of the All Movies listing, add some checkboxes that allow the user to filter the list to show only movies with certain MPAA ratings:

![Screenshot. The filter should be included somewhere below the page heading. It should have a checkbox for each rating, followed by a "Refresh" button.](../filter-screenshot.png)


![Screenshot showing the "Movie Title" column selected with a yellow background.](../table-header-screenshot.png)

When the Refresh button is pressed, the list of movies is redisplayed showing only those movies whose ratings were checked.

This will require a couple of pieces of code. We have provided the
code that generates the checkboxes form, which you can include in the
`index.html.erb` template.  (The `id` attributes on some of the
elements are required for the autograder to work, so don't change/delete them.)

```erb
<%= form_tag movies_path, method: :get, id: 'ratings_form' do %>
  Include:
  <% @all_ratings.each do |rating| %>
    <div class="form-check  form-check-inline">
      <%= label_tag "ratings[#{rating}]", rating, class: 'form-check-label' %>
      <%= check_box_tag "ratings[#{rating}]", "1",  @ratings_to_show.include?(rating), class: 'form-check-input' %>
    </div>
  <% end %>
  <%= submit_tag 'Refresh', id: 'ratings_submit', class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
<% end %>
```

BUT, you have to do a bit of work to use the above code:

1. As you can see, it expects the variable `@all_ratings` to be an
enumerable collection of all possible values of a movie rating, such
as `['G','PG','PG-13','R']`. The controller action needs to set up
this variable. And since the possible values of movie ratings are
really the responsibility of the Movie model, it's best if the
controller sets this variable by consulting the Model. Hence, good
form would be to create a class method of `Movie` that returns an
appropriate value for this collection, say `Movie.all_ratings`, and
have the controller assign that to the appropriate instance variable
for the view to pick up.

2. The [documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.2.11/) for
`check_box_tag` says that the third value, evaluated as a Boolean,
tells whether the checkbox should be displayed as checked or not.  In
the code above, `@ratings_to_show` is assumed to be a collection of
which ratings should be checked.  So `@ratings_to_show.include?('G')`
would be true if `'G'` was a member of the collection.  The controller
action must also set up this array, _even if no check boxes are
checked._

<details>
<summary>
Why must the controller set up an empty-array value for
`@ratings_to_show` even if nothing is checked?
</summary>
<blockquote>
If it doesn't, then `@ratings_to_show` will have a `nil` value in the
view, and trying to call `nil.include?` will cause an exception.
</blockquote>
</details>

You will also need code in the controller that knows (i) how to figure out which boxes the user checked and (ii) how to restrict the database query based on that result.

Regarding (i), try viewing the source of the movie listings with the
checkbox form, and you'll see that the checkboxes have field names
like `ratings[G]`, `ratings[PG]`, etc. This trick will cause Rails to
aggregate the values into a single hash called `ratings`, whose keys
will be the names of the checked boxes only, and whose values will be
the value attribute of the checkbox (which is "1" by default, since we
didn't specify another value when calling the `check_box_tag`
helper). That is, if the user checks the **G** and **R** boxes,
`params` will include as one if its values `:ratings=>{"G"=>"1",
"R"=>"1"}`. Check out the `Hash` documentation for an easy way to grab
just the keys of a hash, since we don't care about the values in this
case (checkboxes that weren't checked don't appear in the `params`
hash at all). 

Regarding (ii), you'll probably end up replacing `Movie.all` in the
controller method. Since most
interesting code should go in the model rather than exposing details
of the schema to the controller, consider defining a
class-level method in the model such as `Movie.with_ratings(ratings)`
that takes an array of ratings (e.g. `["r", "pg-13"]`) and returns an
ActiveRecord relation of movies whose rating matches
(case-insensitively) anything in that array.  To do its job, this
method can make use of `Movie.where`, which has various options to
help you restrict the database query.  **Hint:** read the
[documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v4.2.11) about
`ActiveRecord::Base` (on the docs page, click the flippy triangle next
to the class name `ActiveRecord` and find the interior class `Base`)
for examples of how to use `where` to do queries like this.  The
[ActiveRecord Intro CHIPS assignment](/saasbook/hw-activerecord-intro)  may be helpful too.

### IMPORTANT for grading purposes

* As in the code above, your form tag should have the id `ratings_form`
and the form submit button for filtering by ratings should have 
id `ratings_submit`.
* Each checkbox should have an HTML element id of `ratings_#{rating}`,
where the interpolated rating should be the rating itself, such as
`ratings_PG-13`, `ratings_G`, and so on.

### Hints

_We suggest_ adding a class method in `Movie` as follows:

```ruby
class Movie
  def self.with_ratings(ratings_list)
  # if ratings_list is an array such as ['G', 'PG', 'R'], retrieve all
  #  movies with those ratings
  # if ratings_list is nil, retrieve ALL movies
  end
 end
 ```

Using the debugger, take a look at what is in `params[]` when the form
is submitted with various checkboxes checked, and particularly, what
is in `params[:ratings]` (or `params['ratings']` -- special hashes in
Rails such as `params` and `session` can be accessed by either strings
or symbols, even though hashes in Ruby do not generally behave this
way).

Notice that you will need to use the `params[:ratings]` values in two
ways in the controller: to determine what values to pass to
`Movie.with_ratings`,  and to set a variable that can be used by the
view so that the appropriate checkboxes show up as checked when the
filtered view is loaded.

If _no_ boxes are checked (including the first time the user visits
the page), all movies should be listed.

### To pay attention to...

__Labels__: You may notice that we have included a HTML `label` alongside the checkbox. These labels are critical for a properly functioning form! Primarily, they tell users what checkbox they are about to select. However, labels also provide built-in accessibility features (such as for blind users, so they too know what each checkbox does) or handy shortcuts like clicking "G" to apply the "G" checkbox. (On a phone, for example, this means users are less likely to tap on the wrong action.)

_Styling_: We've included some default Bootstrap styling. This is not required to make your form work, but it's a comming pattern. You are welcome to tweak the CSS classes applied to the form as long as the application works correctly.

Reminder: Don't put code in your views! If you find yourself doing
computation in your views, set up an instance variable in the
controller and do the computation there instead.  And if the computation
is anything more than trivial, it probably belongs in a model, not in
the controller.

You'll submit this part after you deploy on Heroku and when you supply your Heroku deployment URL in part 3. But you can commit all the changes you have made so far to git, deploy them to Heroku and check that they work on Heroku before moving on to the next section:

```sh
$ git commit -am "part 1 complete"
$ git push heroku master
```

**NOTE!** Be sure that you have used `git add` to add all the new
files you've created!  If in doubt, use `git status` to show which
files Git thinks it does not know about.  A common pitfall is
forgetting to add some files, and then when the app is deployed to
Heroku, it fails because some files are missing.
